During the study for nearly one semester, practicals started to become harder and codes were more complex. 
This practical was not easy and needed a lot of time to finish it. It took me more than 4 hours to complete it with the cooperation with my classmates.
In the practical, I have reviewed the knowledge of making images and practise my logically capability. 
I found that I was still not familiar with some basic knowledge, which should be pay more attention during the review.
