Question name: How have new cases and total cases developed over time in China?
Line number:98-119
Result discussion: At the begining, the number of people suffered from the disease increase rapidly 
but after a while the number of patients start to grow slowlier and finally almost keep invariability.
From the result we can see that though Chinese suffered a lot from disease, we  have controled the
disease successfully. However, we still failed to cure the disease completely so the total number of 
patients has not decreased.
