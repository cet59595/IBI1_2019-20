Due to the affect of COVID-19 I spent most of my time studying at home.
Therefore, the internet as well as slides are the only way for me to learn Python.
It is challenge but also interesting, because I could learn a lot from the process when I trying to solve some problems.
Though each practical would take me about 4 hours to finish completely, in each moment I would always get some new ideas which deepen my understanding of python.
However, maybe because I was not so familiar with the lecture I had to review slides when I meet some difficulitis.
In the first two practicals we start to deal with some easy problems, not contain very complex logical calculation.
However, the latest practicals are much more complated which should I make a lot of drafts in advance.
From this semester I can see my progress in IBI learning and get to know a large variety of knowledges.
I believed that in the future, I would be eager to explore more about the biomedical informatics to let me enable to enjoy the charm of program.
