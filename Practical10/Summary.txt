From the practical, we can find that the similiarity of consequence of amino acid between human and mouse is very high, compared with the random sequence.
The similiarity of the amino acid between human and mouse is about 89.64%.
The similiarity between human amino acid sequence and random amino acid sequence is about 5.41%
The similiarity between mouse amino acid sequence and random amino acid sequence is about 5.86%
Therefore, we can see that though mouse does not look like human, they  are close related.
