At first we picked one number to calculate with another, which should be six possible ways.
Than each number we got would repeat the above process with another number.
The complexity of the script is nearly (n!)^2.
For a sequence with n digits, there are 6*n*(n-1)/2     (n-1)-digit sequence. 
Therefore, the times it operated is  [6^(n-1)] * n*[(n-1)^2]*[(n-2)^2]*……*1/[2^(n-1)]
From this we can know that  the  total times it operated is [3^(n-1)]*[(n!)^2]/n.
So, we can estimate that O(n) = (n!)^2
It took a lot of time to calculate which is complicated and not effective.
